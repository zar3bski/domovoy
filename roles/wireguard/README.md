Use an existing key pair or generate one following the [documentation](https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/). You can add `peers` directly in the inventory.

This role can set multiples interfaces up. Depending on the presence of `WG_PORT`, the configured interface will act as a server or a client.  

In server mode, packets forwarding is set between `eth0` and `wg?` both ways and relies on **MASQUERADE**. See `roles/wireguard/templates/add-nat-routing.sh.j2` and `roles/wireguard/templates/remote-nat-routing.sh.j2` for details.
